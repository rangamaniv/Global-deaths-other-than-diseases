# Global-deaths-other-than-diseases
Project: This project involves four datasets that are merged to study global deaths due 
to causes other than diseases. The secondary datasets are merged with the primary dataset 
to analyze the causes of death for each country across various years based on the GDP value
and income group of each country. The fourth supplementary dataset groups each country 
into a region and sub-region and is added for analysis purposes by region.
I.	Primary Dataset:  Global cause of deaths other than diseases
Data source: This dataset was part of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017 project (https://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2017) coordinated by the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation(IHME), University of Washington, Seattle.  The dataset contains the number of deaths within a country each year, along with the causes of deaths such as conflict and terrorism, famine, pandemics, natural disasters, and other injuries for various countries. The data for the different causes of death have been assimilated from IHME individual files into a single table and are available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tahminashoaib86/global-cause-of-the-deaths-other-than-diseases).  This dataset also includes the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data for each country and by year. These are global causes of death other than diseases.
II.	Secondary Dataset 1: GDP (Gross Domestic Product) Data 
Data source: This dataset was retrieved from the World Bank Group's Open Data and is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sazidthe1/world-gdp-data.  The World Bank Group is a renowned institution for global economic data. This secondary dataset provides the GDP value for each country by year. 
III.	Secondary Dataset 2: World Data Bank data by Country, Year and Income Group
Data source: This dataset is sourced from The World Bank Data: https://datacatalogfiles.worldbank.org/ddh-published/0037712/DR0090754/OGHIST.xlsx. The World Bank Group is a renowned institution for global economic data. This secondary dataset provides the income group for each country by year. The dataset contains data in a crosstab format and for analysis purposes, it has been changed to a table format using Excel Power Query editor.
IV.	Supplementary Dataset: United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Data for each country with regions, sub-regions.
Data source: This dataset is sourced from the UNSD data: https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview. 
The UNSD data has regional, sub-regional, and intermediate region listed for each country. For analysis purposes, the derived dataset here has only the regions and sub-regions listed for each country.
