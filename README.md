# Global-deaths-other-than-diseases
Project: This project involves four datasets which are merged to study global deaths due 
to causes other than diseases. The secondary datasets are merged with the primary dataset 
to analyze the causes of deaths for each country across various years based on GDP value
and income group of each country. The fourth supplementary dataset groups each country 
into a region and sub-region and is added for analysis purposes by region.
